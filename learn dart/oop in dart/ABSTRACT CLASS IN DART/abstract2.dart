Introduction
In this section, you will learn about dart abstract class. 
Before learning about abstract class, 
you should have a basic understanding of class, object, 
constructor, and inheritance. 
Previously you learned how to define a class. 
These classes are concrete classes. 
You can create an object of concrete classes, 
but you cannot create an object of abstract classes.
